v.1.1 -- 3 Oct 2017

* Updated to Bootstrap 4.0.0-beta.2
* As Bootstrap 4 JS changed from using Tether to using Popper, the same here.
* Sidebar now becomes offcanvas for small viewport widths.
* Other minor Pug and CSS improvements.

v.1.0.1 -- 18 Feb 2017

* Scripts (as coped from [http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/getting-started/introduction/#starter-template](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/getting-started/introduction/#starter-template)) were not working in `gh-pages` demo -- so I swapped in the same scripts served from CDNJS instead.
